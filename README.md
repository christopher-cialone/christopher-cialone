<h1 align="center"> :test_tube:  I'm Christopher - I transform ideas into action</h1>
<h3 align="center">creating decentralized, distributed solutions for the betterment of both users & service providers</h3>

- ⚡ I’m currently **changing the way users interact with services. I am building a decentralized marketplace with cross-chain operability: harnessing the speed of Solana's network, the ability to vault Bitcoin, and meaningful interaction betweeen users and businesses including a review/reputation aspect incentivizing services to tailor to user's needs + wants** 

- :coffee:   I’m looking to collaborate on **improving the lives of acutal people through decentralized & distributed applications + systems**

- :ninja: **There is an organized attempt to censor and manipulate the information we receive. I, and others like me, are here to change that. Join the resistance. We want the truth**
