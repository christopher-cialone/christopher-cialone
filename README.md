### *Censorship Resistance: Decentralized and Distributed Software Solutions*  👋


<h1 align="center">👋 I'm Christopher, I transform ideas into action</h1>
<h3 align="center">Developing un-developed ideas</h3>

- ⚡ I’m currently **changing the way users interact with services. I am building a decentralized marketplace with cross-chain operability: harnessing the speed of Solana's network, the ability to vault Bitcoin, and meaningful interaction betweeen users and businesses including a review/reputation aspect incentivizing services to tailor to user's needs + wants** 

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **improving the lives of acutal people through decentralized & distributed applications + systems**

- 👨‍💻 My website is available at *https://www.rosalone.com/*

- 📝 I regularly write articles on [https://medium.com/@cialone.codes](https://medium.com/@cialone.codes)

- 💬 Ask me about **why we as developers and engineers must better educate users in regard to the inevitability of decentralization -- or the inevitability of corporate tyranny**
